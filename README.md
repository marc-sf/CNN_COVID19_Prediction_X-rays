# CNN - COVID-19 Prediction Based on Lung X-rays

The objective of this notebook is to build a model to predict if a person has Covid-19 or other infections or no lung infection from the lung x-rays.

The dataset contains lungs x-rays classified by three labels:
- COVID-19: from patients suffering from COVID-19.
- Non-COVID: from patients suffering from other diseases.
- Healthy: from patients classified as healthy.

### ** This was a academic group assignment in which we tried different approaches: DNNs and CNNs, with differents combinations of the x-ray and mask images. This notebook shows only my modeling approach. **
